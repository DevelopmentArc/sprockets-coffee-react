= sprockets-coffee-react

== Compatibility
sprockets-coffee-react 2.x is compatible with react ^0.12.0

sprockets-coffee-react 0.x is compatible with react <=0.11.0

== How to use

Add this to your Gemfile:

  gem 'sprockets-coffee-react'

Place a <tt>.js.coffee.cjsx</tt> or <tt>.js.cjsx</tt> file (or a <tt>.js.coffee</tt> file with a 
<tt>@cjsx</tt> pragma) in your assets directory. When you require it into other JS files the CJSX
markup will be transformed and compiled to Javascript.

Eg. if you have a file called <tt>my-component.js.coffee</tt> which contains 
some CJSX code, require it from <tt>application.js</tt> or somewhere else:

  //= require my-component

== How to use with a Rack application

If you're not using rails, you'll need to register the Sprockets preprocessor manually. Here is an 
adapted version of the Rack example provided by Sprockets, which additionally requires and registers 
the sprockets-coffee-react engine:

  require 'sprockets'
  require 'sprockets/coffee-react'
  map '/assets' do
    environment = Sprockets::Environment.new
    environment.append_path 'app/assets/javascripts'
    environment.append_path 'app/assets/stylesheets'
    environment.register_preprocessor 'application/javascript', Sprockets::CoffeeReact
    environment.register_engine '.cjsx', Sprockets::CoffeeReactScript
    environment.register_engine '.js.cjsx', Sprockets::CoffeeReactScript
    run environment
  end

  map '/' do
    run YourRackApp
  end
